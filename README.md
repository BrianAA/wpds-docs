# WPDS Documentation site

We built this site to document the WPDS UI Kit. It's built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). It's hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). It's written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

## Getting started

We assume a Node.js environment using `stable` version of Node.js and NPM +8.3.0.

```bash
npm install
```

```bash
npm run dev
```

## v1 Site Launch Plan

1. launch v1 at https://build.washingtonpost.com. then move v0 to https://build.washingtonpost.com/v0 (move v0 into a /v0 sub directory)
1. use a small site wide banner for 2 - 3 weeks to help with discovery of v0
