# WPDS Documentation site

We built this site to document the WPDS UI Kit. It's built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). It's hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). It's written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

## Getting started

We assume a Node.js environment using `stable` version of Node.js and NPM +8.3.0.

```bash
npm install
```

```bash
npm run dev
```
