## Options

###

VisuallyHidden accepts `props.children` to set the label.

```jsx
// preview
import { VisuallyHidden, Box } from "@washingtonpost/wpds-ui-kit";

export default function Example() {
  return (
    <>
      <span>
        Tab into this element to see VisuallyHidden used for a "Skip link"
        feature.
      </span>
      <VisuallyHidden
        as="a"
        href="#hello-world"
        css={{
          color: "$cta",
        }}
        data-testid="skip-link"
        onClick={function onClickHandler(event: {
          preventDefault: () => void,
        }) {
          event.preventDefault();
        }}
      >
        This is a visually hidden label
      </VisuallyHidden>
    </>
  );
}
```

## Accessibility

Visually hides an element from sighted users but still maintains it for screen readers and other assistive technologies. This is a common pattern used in web applications.

---

## Implementation

```jsx
import { VisuallyHidden } from "@washingtonpost/wpds-ui-kit";

export default function Example() {
  return <VisuallyHidden>My important label for screen readers</VisuallyHidden>;
}
```
