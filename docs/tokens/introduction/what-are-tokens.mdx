## Introduction to tokens
Design tokens are all the values needed to construct and maintain a 
design system — spacing, color, typography, object styles, animation, 
etc. — represented as data. These can represent anything defined by design: 
a color as a RGB value, an opacity as a number, an animation ease as Bezier 
coordinates. They’re used in place of hard-coded values in order to ensure flexibility 
and unity across all product experiences.

This allows for better shared control between designers and engineers. Another 
benefit to using tokens is it allows platforms that do not support WPDS react components 
to still be aligned with the design system at a super foundational level.

## Token Types
Tokens can be anything that can be represented as a value. We currently support 7 tokens types.
[Colors](../our-tokens/color) [Icons](../our-tokens/icons) [Typography](../our-tokens/typography) 
[Spacing](../our-tokens/spacing) [Logos](../our-tokens/spacing) [Shadows](../our-tokens/shadows) 
[Motion](../our-tokens/motion). These tokens make up our entire 
system foundation.
